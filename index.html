<h1>Zheyu Jiang</h1>
<p>I recently graduated with a PhD in chemical engineering at Purdue University, USA. My graduate research has been focused on the design and optimization of new, energy efficient and cost effective multicomponent distillation systems.
<p>I was supervised by Professor Rakesh Agrawal (Main) and Professor Mohit Tawarmalani (Co-advised). My thesis is titled <i>Multicomponent distillation - Mathematical Modeling, Global Optimization, and Process Intensification </i>.
<p>My CV can be found <a href="zheyujiang.github.io/cv.pdf">here</a>.
