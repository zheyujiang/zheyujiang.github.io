<h1>Zheyu Jiang</h1>
<p>I recently graduated with a PhD in chemical engineering at Purdue University, USA. My graduate research has been focused on the design and optimization of new, energy efficient and cost effective multicomponent distillation systems.
<p>I was supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Agrawal_(chemical_engineer)">Professor Rakesh Agrawal</a> (Main) and <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mtawarma/">Professor Mohit Tawarmalani</a> (Co-advised). My thesis is titled <i>Multicomponent distillation - Mathematical Modeling, Global Optimization, and Process Intensification.</i>
<p>My CV can be found <a href="https://zheyujiang.github.io/zheyujiang.github.io/CV_Jan_2019.pdf">here</a>.
